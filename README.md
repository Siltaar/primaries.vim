## Primaries.vim
A vim theme for programmers, inpired by good code from
[mango.vim](https://github.com/goatslacker/mango.vim), good colors from
[mustang.vim](https://github.com/croaker/mustang-vim), in good readability
from [monochrome.vim](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome).

I thought monochrome.vim was a good idea, but a bit extremist, so I added a few
drops of color.

## Installation

	$ git clone https://github.com/Siltaar/primaries.vim
	cp primaries.vim/colors/primaries.vim ~/.vim/colors/

Then, place in your `.vimrc` :
	color primaries.vim
